# Task
A task I got as a part of a jobinterview.

Basically I was going to convert a given design to a responsive web site, and create a javascript that renders the menu and content on page load from a json file. 

(Still in progress)

`npm install ejs`

`npm install express`

`node server.js`

`localhost:8000`
